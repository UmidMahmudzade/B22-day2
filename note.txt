We just published our local git repo to remote github.com repo
Few things happened:
1. It automatically acreated something


now our work will continue localy
1.add new filecalled note.txt
2.commited the chjange  to local repo
3.we want this change to be reflected on our remote repository so we push local commit to remote repo using "push origin" button
4.observe it on github.com(remote repo) 

we dont have to push one commit at a time, we can push all later
